# Predicting-Readmission-of-Diabetic-Patients
 Our Main Objective of this Project is to identify the Critical factors that
influence readmission for diabetes &amp; to predict the probability of
patient readmission Using Machine Learning models in Python.
 The dataset we provide can be downloaded from https://archive.ics.
uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-
2008#. The dataset represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care
at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over
50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes.
 The Purpose of this project is to predict whether the patient will be
readmitted to the hospital or not. For predicting it most accurately. We
have used various prediction models and seen their performance in
order to get the best results.
  Performed Explanatory Data Analysis and applied extensive feature
engineering, feature selection. The feature selection was done on the
basis of PCA and the correlation analysis. Data was converted and
pre-processed by removing null values and changing categorical
variables.
 Beautiful plots to analyze how the dataset is distributed on the basis
of race, age, gender etc. The EDA gave us some interesting insights
as the readmission is more in female people and in the Caucasian
race.
Models applied are -
 Logistic Regression.
 Random Forest Classifier.
 Adaboosted Classification Model.
 Hyperparameters Tunning For Adaboosted.

 The overall comparison of methods on the basis of their accuracy
sensitivity and ROC Values was generated as the output with
Random forest Classifier as the best model with 64% accuracy.

 Our results showed that number of inpatient and number of
diagnoses are the two most critical factors in readmission prediction.
These results provided valuable suggestions to inpatients monitoring
policy that may reduce short-term readmission and public healthcare
costs in the future.
